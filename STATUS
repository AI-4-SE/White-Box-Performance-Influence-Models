We claim the available badge, since (1) we have implemented and documented all neccessary scripts and put them in an publicly-available repository, (2) we make all raw data needed to execute the profiling and machine-learning process publicly available, and (3) we provide the scripts that we used for data processing.
We also provide the performance measuement data, as one would need multiple years of CPU time for reproducing our results (which includes performance measurements and data processing).
Some knowledge is needed to setup and use the slurm measurement cluster. Besides that, there is only basic knowledge in Linux and python neccessary to replicate our results.
