## Requirements

### Profiling Performance

Hardware requirements depend on the software system and the workload should be executed in the experiments. We measured 9 real-word Java software systems with 27 desktop computers, each of them equipped with an Intel Quad-Core processor, an SSD running Ubuntu 18.04.03 LTS headless, an HDD to store the profiling data, and 8GB or 16GB of RAM (we grouped the cluster such that each group a consistent amount of RAM).
On each node of the cluster there is `java-8-openjdk` and `Python 3.7.5` installed.


### Learning Method-Level Models

We used an Laptop with an i7-10710U processor, 16GB RAM and 500GB SSD running an Manjaro Linux. To execute the modeling scripts you need to have `Python 3` installed with all python packages listed in the `requirements.txt`.
