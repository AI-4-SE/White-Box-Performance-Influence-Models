## Experiment Data

Here, we provide the white-box performance measurements. Each file in the ```data``` folder contains the measurement data of one experiment. Each experiment is defined by the subject system, the sampling strategie, and the profiler. In order to reduce file size, we compressed the experiment files with [gzip](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/gzip/).
